## Theoretical Framework

### Markov Decision Process Formulation

The segmentation refinement problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), defined by the tuple (S, A, P, R, γ):

- **State space S**: Representations of current segmentation, ground truth (during training), and image features
- **Action space A**: Continuous actions that modify segmentation parameters
- **Transition dynamics P(s'|s,a)**: Deterministic transitions based on segmentation modifications
- **Reward function R(s,a,s')**: Multi-objective function measuring segmentation quality
- **Discount factor γ**: Balances immediate vs. future rewards (typically 0.99)

### Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

The system implements a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning paradigm where:

- Each agent specializes in optimizing a specific aspect of segmentation quality
- Agents share a common environment (the segmentation) but have individual policies
- Coordination is achieved through weighted aggregation of agent actions
- The joint policy emerges from individual agent specializations without explicit communication

## System Architecture

The HYPERA segmentation system employs a hierarchical architecture with three primary layers:

1. **Base Segmentation Layer**: Initial segmentation using U-Net or similar deep learning models
2. **Agent Refinement Layer**: Multiple specialized agents that refine the initial segmentation
3. **Coordination Layer**: Manages agent interactions and resolves conflicts

### Component Interaction Flow

```
Input Image → Base Segmentation → Agent Refinement → Coordination → Final Segmentation
                                     ↑                    ↑
                                     |                    |
                            State Representation    Reward Calculation
                                     ↑                    ↑
                                     |                    |
                              Feature Extraction    Evaluation Metrics
```

## Agent Specializations

The system employs five specialized agents, each focusing on a different aspect of segmentation quality:

### RegionAgent

**Technical Definition**: Optimizes regional overlap between predicted and ground truth segmentations through Dice coefficient maximization.

**Implementation Details**:
- State representation: Convolutional features from current segmentation and ground truth

- Policy network: SAC with boundary-specific feature extractor
- Reward component: Hausdorff distance and boundary F1-score

### ShapeAgent

**Technical Definition**: Enforces morphological constraints and shape priors on segmented objects.

- State representation: Object-level features from connected component analysis
- Action space: Object detection threshold and minimum size parameters
- Policy network: SAC with object-aware feature extractor
- Reward component: Object count accuracy and size distribution metrics

## Reinforcement Learning Implementation

### Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) Framework

All agents implement the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, characterized by:

1. **Off-policy learning**: Enables sample-efficient training through experience replay
2. **Entropy regularization**: Encourages exploration through policy entropy maximization
3. **Actor-critic architecture**: Separate networks for policy (actor) and value estimation (critic)
4. **Automatic temperature tuning**: Adaptive entropy coefficient based on target entropy

### Mathematical Formulation

The SAC objective function maximizes:

```
J(π) = E[∑(γᵗ(R(sₜ,aₜ,sₜ₊₁) + α·H(π(·|sₜ))))]
```

Where:
- π is the policy
- E is the expectation over states from the replay buffer and actions from the policy
- H is the entropy
- α is the temperature parameter
- γ is the discount factor

### Neural Network Architecture

Each agent employs three primary networks:

1. **Policy Network**: Gaussian policy with state-dependent mean and standard deviation
2. **Q-Networks**: Dual Q-networks for value estimation with target networks
3. **Feature Extractor**: Agent-specific architecture for state representation

## Multi-Objective Reward System

### Reward Decomposition

The overall reward function is decomposed into specialized components:

```
R(s,a,s') = ∑ wᵢ · Rᵢ(s,a,s')
```

Where:
- Rᵢ are individual reward components
- wᵢ are adaptive weights
- n is the number of reward components

### Component Definitions

1. **Regional Overlap Reward**: R_region = Dice(pred, gt)
2. **Boundary Accuracy Reward**: R_boundary = 1 - normalized(Hausdorff(pred, gt))
3. **Shape Regularization Reward**: R_shape = ShapeConsistency(pred)
4. **FG-BG Balance Reward**: R_balance = F1(pred, gt)
5. **Object Detection Reward**: R_object = ObjectCountAccuracy(pred, gt)

### Adaptive Weight Management

Weights are dynamically adjusted using:

1. **Performance-based adaptation**: Increase weights for underperforming components
2. **Correlation analysis**: Reduce weights for highly correlated components
3. **Training phase adjustment**: Different weight distributions for exploration vs. exploitation

## Agent Coordination Mechanisms

### Coordination Strategies

The SegmentationAgentCoordinator implements three coordination strategies:

1. **Weighted Average**: Combines agent refinements using adaptive weights
   ```
   seg_final = (∑ wᵢ · segᵢ) / (∑ wᵢ)
   ```

2. **Priority-Based**: Applies refinements sequentially based on agent priority
   ```
   seg_final = A_n(A_{n-1}(...A_1(seg_initial)))
   ```

3. **Consensus-Based**: Applies refinements only where multiple agents agree
   ```
   seg_final(x,y) = 1, if ∑ I[segᵢ(x,y) > 0.5] ≥ τ·n
                   = 0, otherwise
   ```
   Where I[] is the indicator function and τ is the consensus threshold

### Conflict Resolution

When agents propose contradictory refinements, conflicts are resolved through:

1. **Confidence-based arbitration**: Higher confidence predictions take precedence
2. **Specialization-aware weighting**: Agents have higher influence in their domain of expertise
3. **Ensemble decision making**: Majority voting for binary decisions

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Representation Standardization

All agents implement standardized state representation with:

1. **Batch dimension handling**: Ensuring [batch_size, state_dim] shape
2. **Feature normalization**: Z-score normalization for stable training
3. **Dimension standardization**: Consistent state dimensions across agents

### Action Application

Actions are applied through:

1. **Parameter modification**: Actions modify segmentation parameters
2. **Differentiable operations**: Enabling end-to-end gradient flow
3. **Bounded transformations**: Actions are bounded to prevent extreme modifications

### Training Process

The training process follows:

1. **Pre-training**: Initial policy learning on diverse datasets
2. **Curriculum learning**: Gradually increasing task difficulty
3. **Experience replay**: Off-policy learning from stored transitions
4. **Parallel agent updates**: Simultaneous training of all agents

## Layman's Explanation

Imagine a team of medical specialists examining an X-ray image:

- The **RegionAgent** is like a radiologist focusing on the overall shape and size of organs
- The **BoundaryAgent** is like a surgeon concerned with precise organ boundaries
- The **ShapeAgent** is like an anatomist ensuring biological plausibility
- The **FGBalanceAgent** is like a quality control specialist ensuring nothing is missed
- The **ObjectDetectionAgent** is like a pathologist counting and measuring abnormalities

Each specialist makes recommendations based on their expertise, and a chief physician (the Coordinator) combines these recommendations into a final diagnosis. The system learns over time which specialists to trust more for different types of cases.

Instead of one doctor trying to do everything, this team of specialists works together, each becoming increasingly expert in their focus area. This leads to more accurate results than any single approach could achieve.

## Future Research Directions

1. **Meta-learning for agent adaptation**: Enabling agents to quickly adapt to new imaging modalities
2. **Hierarchical reinforcement learning**: Adding higher-level agents for strategic coordination
3. **Uncertainty-aware decision making**: Incorporating uncertainty estimates into agent actions
4. **Explainable AI integration**: Providing rationales for agent decisions
5. **Federated learning extensions**: Enabling privacy-preserving distributed training
