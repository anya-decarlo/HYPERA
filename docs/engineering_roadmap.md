# HYPERA Engineering Roadmap

This document outlines potential engineering tasks and product improvements for the HYPERA system that an engineer could help implement.

## High-Priority Engineering Tasks

### 1. Graph-Based Segmentation Integration

**Description:** Enhance HYPERA's segmentation capabilities by integrating graph-based approaches to improve cell connectivity analysis and boundary refinement.

**Tasks:**
- Implement Region Adjacency Graph (RAG) extraction from segmentation masks
  - Convert segmented cells into nodes with unique IDs
  - Create edges between adjacent cells
  - Use libraries like scikit-image and NetworkX for implementation
- Develop edge weighting mechanisms:
  - Distance between cell centroids
  - Shared boundary length
  - Intensity similarity from color/feature channels
- Create a GraphSegmentationAgent to optimize graph-based refinement
- Integrate with existing segmentation frameworks (MONAI, PlantSeg)

MONAI is a framework that includes implementations of U-Net and other segmentation models. When you train a segmentation model in MONAI, it will generate segmentation masks.
What you would need the engineer's help with is:

Converting these segmentation masks into region adjacency graphs (RAGs)
Implementing the code to analyze which segments are adjacent to each other
Creating the graph structure where nodes are segments and edges represent adjacency
Adding properties to the graph (like shared boundary length, distance between centroids, etc.)
